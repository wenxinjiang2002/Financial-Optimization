After receiving several performance-based raises at work and saving up for several years, you finally have enough income and savings to purchase your dream condo in Atlanta. Congratulations!
The property you are purchasing has a closing price of $500,000, for which you put down a 20% down payment ($100,000). You plan to take out a mortgage to finance the remaining $400,000. At the bank, your mortgage officer offers you three fixed-rate mortgage choices。。
